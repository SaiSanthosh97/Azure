Virtual Network
Network – Interconnection of devices
We are connection Virtual machines. 
Connections is made through IP
There are two types of IP i.e., Public IP (External) and private IP (Internal).
Public means externally accessible. External facing URL are public. Every URL will be tied up to some IP we can do nslookup.
Subnet is division of VNet
How do you connect to private IP through external?
Private ranges assigned by IANA. 
Three types of ranges. Class A, B, C
A-	10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255/ 10.0.0.0/8
B-	172.16.0.0 – 172.16.255.255/172.16.0.0/16
C-	192.168.0.0- 192.168.255.255/192.168.0.0/24
These ranges are default. Other than these are public.
Private IP can be used by anyone in that range.
Public IP is unique. If we host some website some IP will be tied to that URL and I own it and will have to pay to maintain that. We call it DNS entry
Host entry, DNS mapping
How IP address will be assigned. If we need 3 subnets of 64,32,16
192.168.0.0/26 can have 64 IP
192.168.0.64/27 can have 32 IP
192.168.0.96/27 can have 16 IP
255 is the maximum we can have and once when we reach the limit. The address changes to 192.168.1.0
0 is called Network address. The first IP will be network address. It doesn’t have to be 0.0
0.255 or the last address is called Broadcast address. 0.1 is default gateway. 0.2,0.3 is used for DNS servers. 
Whenever we are creating VN we need to take /29 minimum.
