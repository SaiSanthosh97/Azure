Storage
Two types: Managed disk and Unmanaged disk/storage account
Under Unmanaged we have following storage accounts
-Blobs, Fileshares, queues, Tables
Blobs: stores Text/binary, image,video. Os image all kind of unstructured data. Its format is .vhd(Virtual hard drive).
Fileshare: Sharing files across network
Queues: a service for storing large numbers of messages.
Tables: SQL, NoSQL data.
Managed disk:
HDD,SSD

SDD IOPS(Input ouput per second) is more like read and write speed will be fast
Why Managed disk is preferred because everything will be managed by Microsoft.
Azure will be replicating our data across data centers which make it Redundant 
LRS- locally redundant storage
ZRS- Zone redundant storage
LRS, ZRS works in the primary region
GRS- Geo redundant storage
GZRS  - Geo Zone redundant storage
GRS and GZRS works in the primary secondary region

LRS stores three copies in three different racks. Whatever data we put it will make 3 copies. Replicates 3 times.
ZRS – Will have to three region with having one copy in each region
GRS- will have to different regions  and different zone with three copies in each region
GZRS – Primary and secondary storage. Primary means LRS and secondary will be GRS
